For isolating different version of pythons in ubuntu:

https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/
https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer   (this one is more accurate then 1st link)

follow these blogs to install pyenv.... 
for instance you can run this command to install pyenv

curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yyuu/pyenv-installer/master/bin/pyenv-installer | bash

after this command run these commands 

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev git

once u install u will get an error. pyenv not install like that
blc the pyenv is not recognized blc it is not added in the ubuntu user path yet. so for that go back to 
home in terminal. 
find .bashrc file there..... open the file
add these 3 lines 

PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"

once these 3 lines are added you can install python 3.7 by simply saying 
pyenv install 3.7.1

once installed, you can check which python version you are currently using by saying
pyenv versions

for choosing any specific python version you can use global keyword such as:
pyenv global 3.7.1

and now u can make environment and can install requirements.txt file packages.
For making python virtual environment u can use this command

python -m venv <ENVIRONEMNT_NAME HERE>

and then for activating the environment run this line.
source <ENVIRONEMENT_NAME>/bin/activate

after that you can run your desired application by saying python app.py
